This will be a horror maze game inspired from Kane Pixel's "Backroom" series on YouTube. The aesthetic of the game is that of a PS1 game and it features artefacts such as geometry pushing, affine texture wrapping, accumulated motion blur, etc.
As of yet, I have not used any 3rd party assets or scripts except the HPSX Render Pipeline. (https://github.com/pastasfuture/com.hauntedpsx.render-pipelines.psx/wiki/)

All the models used in the game have been created by me using Blender (The blend file can be found under the _Blender folder).
